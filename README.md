# Transformers

This repository illustrates how to leverage the power of the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) architecture with the help of HuggingFace's package **[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)** and **PyTorch**.

The projects follow a tutorial-like approach, where the implementation details are thoroughly discussed alongside with the code.
